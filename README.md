Description
This project creates a pair of eyes using HTML and CSS. Each eye consists of a white background with a black circle representing the pupil (.ball). The JavaScript code tracks the movement of the mouse cursor (document.onmousemove) and adjusts the position of the pupils accordingly, creating an illusion of eyes following the cursor.
